# Action-Target-Ping
Evaluation program for job

I, Sean walton, am looking for a programming job. I specialize in embedded systems, primarily hardware-firmware interfacing. At CaptionCall/Sorenson Communications, I wrote board-level C/C++ code all the way up to synchronization with a backend server. I wrote a true C++ XML and JSON library that uses a very intuitive API and is faster than SAX and other libraries. I also wrote a DBMS for the 57t device because those that were available were either too large or not C++.

This program is a code analysis test for a job application to Action Target.
